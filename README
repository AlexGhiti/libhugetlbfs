10/03/2006 -- libhugetlbfs-1.0 Released

After roughly one year in development, version 1.0 of libhugetlbfs is here.
It can be downloaded from SourceForge or the OzLabs mirror:

After a series of preview releases, we have tested a huge array of the
supported usage scenarios using benchmarks and real HPC applications.
Usability and reliability have greatly improved.  But... due to the
incredible diversity of applications that exist, there is bound to be a few
that will not work correctly.  

If you experience problems:

 * Read the full HOWTO document.  It is full of hints, notes, warnings, and
   caveats that we have found over time.  This is the best starting point
   for a quick resolution to your issue.

 * Make sure you have enough huge pages allocated.  Even if you think you
   have enough, try increasing it to a number you know you will not use.

 * Set HUGETLB_VERBOSE=99 and HUGETLB_DEBUG=yes.  These options increase
   the verbosity of the library and enable extra checking to help diagnose
   the problem.

If the above steps do not help, send as much information about the problem
(including all libhugetlbfs debug output) to
libhugetlbfs-devel@lists.sourceforge.net and we'll help out as much as we
can.
