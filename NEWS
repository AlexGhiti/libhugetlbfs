libhugetlbfs 1.1 "Carribbean Jerk"
======================================================================

This large release brings several performance improvements

Security

* Remove the sharing daemon completely and rework the segment sharing
  code. Permissions on the hugetlbfs mountpoint are used to enforce
  segment sharing.

Bug fixes

* Sharing of writable segments is no longer possible, due to address
  space randomization on x86_64 (although similar issues could happen on
  any architecture).
* minimal_copy detection should work better in this release.

Trivial but notable changes

* Testcase updates

libhugetlbfs 1.0.1 "Spicy Garlic"
======================================================================

This small maintenance release brings a security fix, a few minor bug
fixes, plus some documentation and error message updates.

Security

* A section on security has been added to the README file
* The hugetlbd daemon socket has been moved from /tmp to /var/run.
  This will require the daemon to be run as root, which was previously
  just a recommendation.

Bug fixes

* Reduce reserved huge pages needed for application start-up
* PPC linker script fixes

Trivial but notable changes

* Always install linker scripts for all targets
* Error message updates
* Add documentation on HUGETLB_DEBUG
* Testcase updates

libhugetlbfs 1.0
======================================================================

* First stable release
