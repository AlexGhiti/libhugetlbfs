libhugetlbfs 2.1 "NM 64"
======================================================================
New Features
* Multiple page size support
* Add a more user friendly allocator that handles cache coloring
* Add pagesize utility to display supported page sizes
* Add hugeadm utility for managing hugepage pools
* Add hugectl utility for running programs using hugepages
* Add hugeedit utility for marking segments in aligned binaries for
  huge page backing by default
* Deprecated linker linker scripts
* gethugepagesize() and getpagesizes() API added to programatically
  discover supported hugepages
* Manual pages for all API functions and utilities
* Allow automatic backing of shared memory segments with hugepages
* huge page regions will no longer prefault for kernels >= 2.6.27
  improving mmap() performance and NUMA layout

Bug Fixes
* Add missing segment to interp section in linker scripts
* Fix free_hugepage_region to handle segments that fell back to small
  pages
* Fix install when lib32 and lib64 resolve to the same place
* Install header files so APIs can be used
* Fix installation paths to make life easier for package maintainers
* Do not export internal symbols unnecessarily
* Prefault regions allocated by direct allocation API on kernels older
  than 2.6.27
* Gracefully fallback to using base pages for text/data when the
  hugepage pool is too small
* Fix handling of HUGETLB_SHARE_PATH environment variable
* Relax remapping requirements

Test suite Fixes
* Added expected failure support
* gethugepagesizes override for getting meminfo
* Increase debug output for tests that fail
* Summarise pass and failure counts

libhugetlbfs 2.0 "Sandia Red"
======================================================================

New Features
* New scriptless relinking for binutils >= 2.17
* Added direct allocator API for huge pages

Bug Fixes
* /proc/mounts is parsed line at a time to handle file larger than 4kb
* Read-only mappings use MAP_NORESERVE

Test suite fixes
* Add test for /proc/mounts file larger than 4kb
* Fix quota test with private reservations
* Output strerror on failure
* linkhuge tests are skipped when known to be broken

libhugetlbfs 1.3 "Big Jim"
======================================================================

New features
* Add HUGETLB_NO_PREFAULT to control prefaulting of huge pages via mlock
* Add "[hostname:pid]" to output messages
* Setup for handling larger huge page sizes e.g. 16G huge pages
* Update for new upstream sysctl
* Add support for hugetlbfs_morecore to shrink the heap

Bug fixes
* Disable heap shrinking by default to avoid bug in glibc malloc
* Skip elflink calls in setup_libhugetlbfs for IA64 and sparc64
* Replace gethugepagesize with check_hugepagesize for error checking
* Make morecore argument a long to handle larger page sizes

Test suite fixes
* Check uid/gid in tests where it matters
* tests: verify there are enough huge pages
* Change tests to read /proc/meminfo
* tests: verify that huge page size isn't too big for the test

libhugetlbfs 1.2 "Mango Habanero"
======================================================================

New features

* Partial segment remapping. This allows non-relinked binaries to try
  to take advantage of libhugetlbfs' segment remapping code. Large
  segments are required, especially on Power. This feature is useful
  for estimating huge page performance, however full relinking will
  still perform better.
* Add extra debugging for binaries that may run out of address space.
* Log library version when HUGETLB_VERBOSE is enabled.
* Beginning support for ia64 and sparc64.
* New test to check handling of misaligned mmap() parameters.

Bug fixes

* Fix EH_FRAME segment. Fixes some C++ applications.
* Rework PLT detection to work better on Power.
* Add per-target-arch syscall stubs to the library. These provide
  reliable error messages from elflink.c if they occur while the
  program segments are unmapped.
* Add proper SONAME to shared libs.
* Makefile respects CFLAGS/LDFLAGS/CPPFLAGS environment variables.
* Make mlock() failure non-fatal.

Test suite fixes

* Fix zero_filesize_segment test.
* Fix the icache-hygeine testcase for i386 and x86_64.
* Fix SEGVs in task-size-overrun test.
* Enable stack_grow_into_huge test, previously skipped.
* Fix test_addr_huge() for anon pages.

libhugetlbfs 1.1 "Carribbean Jerk"
======================================================================

This large release brings several performance improvements

Security

* Remove the sharing daemon completely and rework the segment sharing
  code. Permissions on the hugetlbfs mountpoint are used to enforce
  segment sharing.

Bug fixes

* Sharing of writable segments is no longer possible, due to address
  space randomization on x86_64 (although similar issues could happen on
  any architecture).
* minimal_copy detection should work better in this release.

Trivial but notable changes

* Testcase updates

libhugetlbfs 1.0.1 "Spicy Garlic"
======================================================================

This small maintenance release brings a security fix, a few minor bug
fixes, plus some documentation and error message updates.

Security

* A section on security has been added to the README file
* The hugetlbd daemon socket has been moved from /tmp to /var/run.
  This will require the daemon to be run as root, which was previously
  just a recommendation.

Bug fixes

* Reduce reserved huge pages needed for application start-up
* PPC linker script fixes

Trivial but notable changes

* Always install linker scripts for all targets
* Error message updates
* Add documentation on HUGETLB_DEBUG
* Testcase updates

libhugetlbfs 1.0
======================================================================

* First stable release
